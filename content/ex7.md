# Advanced-ish - OTA updates

If you were curious enough to take a look at SPIFFS, during the [EEPROM exercise](./ex5.md) you probably noticed a little something on the flash layout schematic: "OTA update".

There are a few aways to implement OTA (Over The Air) updates in the ESP8266. You have the ArduinoOTA library (easy way), and a couple of libraries and projects from the community that alow you to request the new sofware from a server and do everything simpler when updating a lot of devices at the same time.

Here we will be using the ArduinoOTA library because the other options would require a server and a lot of fiddling around and tweaking the settings of it.

> If you end up configuring such server, let us know how you did it by creating a issue here. New ideas are always welcome.

## ArduinoOTA

We're not going to explain this example in as much detail as in previous exercises, because that would be a workshop on it's own. All the exercises in the Advanced section are for you to have an idea of the capabilities of this thing and work on them at home.

Let's now access one of the biggest repositories of knowledge about the ESP8266. The 'Examples' menu in the Arduino IDE.
This thing is the best place to get some idea of how all the libraries work. You can try out Mesh Networks and ESP-NOW comunication later, but right now let's focus on OTA.

Go to <code>File > Examples > ArduinoOTA > BasicOTA</code>

This sketch has everything you need to upload code over-the-air.

> I recomend changing the hostname so you know with board is yours. (line 24 of the sketch)

Try uploading the that code to the ESP and let it boot. Then you should see in the <code>Tools > Port</code> and there should be your board as a network device.

After that, add a few lines of code to make the LED blink and try uploading over OTA. <strong>Everytime you upload code over-the-air you need to include the code in this example. Otherwise, when the board boots it will lose the capability of recieving updates over-the-air and you will need to update it through USB.</strong>

You now have a few hours of fun tinkering with OTA updates ahead of you.
